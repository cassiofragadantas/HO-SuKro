# How to use ?

## Color image denoising experiments

Run the script 'DL_image_denoise_3D.m' for an interactive mode.

OR

Run the script 'run_all.m' which will repeatedly call 'DL_image_denoise_3D_input.m' with different simulation parameters.


## Black-and-white image denoising

Run the script 'DL_image_denoise.m' for an interactive mode.
